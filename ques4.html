    <h3>List any  3 ways in which we can increase the accessibility of HTML</h3>
    <p>
        There are several ways to increase the accessibility of HTML and make your web content more inclusive. Here are three essential ways:</p>
        <p><b>Use Semantic HTML:</b> Utilize the appropriate semantic HTML elements to structure your content.Semantic elementsprovide meaning and context to assistive technologies and search engines. They help individuals using screen readers or other assistive devices to understand the structure and purpose of your content more effectively.</p>
        <p><b>Provide Alternative Text for Images: </b>Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the alt attribute. Alt text should convey the purpose and meaning of the image to individuals who cannot see it, such as those with visual impairments or when the image fails to load. Avoid using vague or generic descriptions and strive to provide meaningful and concise alt text.</p>
        <p><b>Implement Keyboard Accessibility: </b>Ensure that your HTML content can be easily navigated and interacted with using a keyboard alone. This is crucial for individuals with mobility impairments who rely on keyboard navigation. Test your website's functionality using only the Tab key to navigate through links, buttons, and form fields. Make sure that all interactive elements are focusable and that the focus is visually indicated. Avoid using elements that rely solely on mouse or touch interactions, as they exclude individuals who cannot use them.</p>

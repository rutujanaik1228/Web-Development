    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.</p>
    <h3>What Do Web Designers Do?</h3>
    <p>Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) and are adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.

        Visitors rate their experience with a specific website based on its aesthetics and how intuitive it is in terms of navigation. Therefore, web designers use Adobe, CorelDraw, Inkscape, and other design programs to create animations, graphics, icons, logos, and other elements of a website to make it as interactive as possible. Web designers also focus on the creative and visual side of the website and follow various design practices, such as symmetry, color systems, proportions, etc. to engage visitors. Additionally, they work on fonts, placement of images and videos, and creating layouts using coding languages.</p>
    <h3>Key Elements of Web Design</h3>
    <p>A good website is one that displays a careful balance between appearance and functionality. When your website is aesthetically pleasing but fails to offer the information or help your audience with what it looks for, the aesthetics cannot make up for the lack of functionality and vice versa. Therefore, web design comprises two broad key elements—aesthetic or visual elements and functional elements—that are of equal importance to make your website stand out.</p>
    <h5>Visual Elements</h5>
    <p>Visual elements come together and set a theme for your website, which leaves a great impact on visitors when you get it right. It is crucial that every element compliments one another and looks harmonious rather than chaotic. Visual elements include:

     <br>   1. Fonts
     <br>   2. Colors
     <br>    3. Shapes
     <br>    4. Layout
     <br>    5. Icons
     <br>    6. Logos
     <br>    7. Images
     <br>    8. Video</p>
     <h5>Functional Elements</h5>
     <p>Functional elements hold great importance in terms of how the search engine views your website. However, they go beyond that and can influence user experience as well. Some of the salient functional elements include the following:

     <br> Navigation: The ease of access your website offers to your visitors to reach different sections of the website
     <br> User interaction: Offering users control by avoiding needless pop-ups, auto-play videos, or overload of information
     <br> Speed: Ensuring the page loads within a couple of seconds
     <br> Site structure: A systematic structure that is easy to navigate both for visitors and the Google web crawler
     <br> Cross-device compatibility</p>
    <h3>What is Responsive Web Design?</h3>
    <p>Responsive web design is a technique used to make certain changes to a website such that it adapts to the screen size and orientation of different devices. A website designed for bigger screens does not fit small screens seamlessly, which causes inconvenience for viewers. Therefore, responsive web design has become a very important factor that influences user experience in recent times, as people use their smartphones and tablets to browse through websites.

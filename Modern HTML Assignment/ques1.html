    <h3>List out feauters of HTML5</h3>
    <P>There are several new features added to HTML5, let's look at some of them.</P>
    <p><b>New Doctype</b><br>
        All HTML documents have a Doctype declaration. Doctype is not an HTML tag. Using the doctype declaration browsers, understand what document type to expect. In previous versions of HTML, the syntax to specify the doctype was long and hard to remember. But the HTML5 doctype is a lot easier to remember, and it is case-insensitive as well.</p>
    <p><b>New Semantic Tags Header and Footer</b><br>
        The header appears at the top of the page, and the footer appears at the bottom. Because of this, the semantic tag's need for <div> tag is eliminated for separating two parts.

            The header mainly contains header elements, author information, icons, or logos, while the footer contains copyright information, contact information, back-to-top links, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Required Attribute</b><br>Forms in HTML have required attributes, which specify to the user whether a particular input is required or not.</p>
    <p><b>Video and Audio Tags</b><br>Developers can use this tag to insert videos and audio into their web pages for a better user experience.</p>
    <p><b>Email Input</b>When we use type email for form input, the browser will validate the email address entered by the user. Older browsers were not compatible with this input type, and input would directly turn into a simple textbox.</p>
    <p><b>Nav Tag</b><br>
        The &lt;nav&gt; tag is used for declaring the navigation sections on a web page. Only the major block of links should be put in the &lt;nav&gt; tag to let the browser know those are not just regular links. They are for the navigation section.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Figure and Figcaption</b><br>
        The &lt;figure &gt; tag is used to mark up photos in a document, and &lt;figcaption&gt;  defines a caption for the images. The &lt;figcaption &gt;  is a child element of &lt;figure&gt;
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Placeholder Attribute</b>
            <br>
    The placeholder attribute intends to give the user a hint about the input field or text area. The text we write in the placeholder will be displayed in the input field before the user enters a value. This html5 feature is helpful for the user interface. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Canvas</b><br>
            The &lt;canvas &gt; tag is newly added to the html5. It is a rectangular area that is used to draw texts, boxes, gradients, and add images. By default, there is no border and text included in this tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Web Storage 
        </b><br>
        One of the best html5 features is web storage. With the help of this html5 feature, web applications can store their data locally within the browser on the client side. This type of storage is the same as cookies, but it is faster and more secure than cookies. Another html5 feature is that we can store the data in the application cache and web SQL database. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Support for Dynamic Web Pages</b>
        <br>
        Web servers send static web pages to the web browser directly without any data modification whenever the user requests the web page. But, with the dynamic web page feature of html5, different contents can be shown to different users while maintaining the same design and layout. This html5 feature is helpful in areas like stock price changes and weather prediction.

    <h1>Write a short note on the tab index</h1>
    <p>The tabindex attribute is an HTML attribute that controls the order in which elements receive focus when using the keyboard to navigate a web page. It determines the sequence in which elements can be accessed through the Tab key.

        By default, elements on a web page are navigated in the order they appear in the HTML source code. However, using the tabindex attribute, you can modify this order and explicitly specify the tabbing sequence.</p>
    <p>The tabindex attribute can take different values such as Positive integers ,0 and-1.</p>
    <p>It's important to use tabindex carefully to ensure a logical and intuitive navigation flow for keyboard users. Modifying the tabbing order should be done judiciously to avoid confusing or disorienting users.</p>
    <p>When using tabindex, consider the following best practices:</p>
    <p>1. Maintain a logical order: Ensure that the tabbing order follows a logical sequence that aligns with the visual flow of the page. This helps users understand and predict the navigation order.</p>
    <p>2. Avoid excessive tabindex values: Overusing or assigning arbitrary tabindex values can lead to a confusing and non-intuitive navigation experience. Stick to a small number of elements that require specific tabbing order adjustments.</p>
    <p>3. Test with different assistive technologies: Test the tabbing order using various assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation, to ensure that the experience is smooth and coherent.</p>
    <p>By using the tabindex attribute appropriately, you can enhance the accessibility of your web page and provide a better experience for users who rely on keyboard navigation.</p>

    <h1> What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our webpage.</h1>
    <p>
        Using semantic tags in a webpage offers several benefits, including:
        <br>

1. Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide meaning and structure to the content, which greatly benefits individuals who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers. These technologies can better understand the organization and purpose of different sections within the document, improving the accessibility and usability of the website for people with disabilities.
<br>
2.Enhanced SEO: Search engine crawlers utilize semantic tags to understand the content and context of a webpage. By using semantic tags appropriately, you can provide clearer signals to search engines about the relevance and importance of different sections of your content, potentially improving your search engine rankings.
<br>
3. Clearer Document Structure: Semantic tags contribute to a clearer and more organized structure of a webpage. They help define the hierarchy and relationships between different sections, such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and main content. This improves the overall readability and comprehension of the page, both for humans and machines.
<br>
4. Future-Proofing and Maintenance: Semantic tags are designed to have consistent and standardized meanings across different devices and platforms. By using these tags, you ensure that your content remains compatible and understandable in the future, as new technologies and devices emerge. Semantic HTML also makes it easier to maintain and update your webpage, as the code is more descriptive and self-explanatory.
<br>
5. Developer-Friendly and Consistent Coding: Semantic tags promote clean and meaningful code. They help developers understand the purpose and function of different elements within the webpage, making it easier to navigate and modify the codebase. Consistent usage of semantic tags also improves code readability and maintainability for both individual developers and collaborative teams.
<br>
By leveraging the benefits of semantic tags, you can create webpages that are more accessible, SEO-friendly, maintainable, and future-proofed, leading to better user experiences and improved visibility in search engines.

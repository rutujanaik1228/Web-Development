    <h3>What is web accessibility?List some of the assistive devices which play a major role in providing accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        Web accessibility refers to the inclusive design and development of websites, web applications, and digital content to ensure that they can be used and accessed by all individuals, including those with disabilities. It aims to remove barriers and provide equal access to information and functionality regardless of a person's abilities or impairments.
        <br>
        Assistive devices play a crucial role in providing accessibility by helping individuals with disabilities interact with digital content. Here are some examples of assistive devices commonly used for web accessibility:
        <br>
        
        <b>Screen Readers:</b> Screen readers are software applications that read out the text on a web page aloud, allowing people with visual impairments to access and navigate websites. Examples include JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.
        <br>
       <b> Braille Displays:</b> Braille displays are hardware devices that convert on-screen text into braille, enabling individuals with visual impairments to read website content through touch. These displays typically have rows of small pins that raise and lower to form braille characters.
        <br>
       <b> Screen Magnifiers:</b> Screen magnifiers enlarge the content displayed on the screen, helping people with low vision or visual impairments to see the website more clearly. Users can adjust the magnification level according to their needs.
        <br>
        
       <b> Speech Recognition Software:</b> Speech recognition software allows individuals with mobility impairments or conditions that affect their ability to type, such as repetitive strain injuries, to control and navigate websites using voice commands. Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Windows Speech Recognition are examples of speech recognition software.
        <br>
       <b> Alternative Input Devices: </b>Alternative input devices provide alternative ways to interact with websites for individuals with physical disabilities. These devices can include mouth sticks, head pointers, sip-and-puff systems, and eye-tracking devices.
        <br>
        <b>
            Closed Captions and Transcripts:</b> Closed captions and transcripts are essential for individuals with hearing impairments. They provide text versions of audio content, such as videos and podcasts, ensuring that people who are deaf or hard of hearing can understand the information. <br> 
        
        <b>Keyboard Accessibility:</b> Keyboard accessibility is crucial for individuals with mobility impairments who cannot use a mouse or touch screen. Websites should be designed and developed to be fully operable using only a keyboard, including navigation, form input, and interaction with interactive elements.
        <br>
        These are just a few examples of assistive devices and technologies used in web accessibility. The goal is to ensure that individuals with disabilities can independently access and interact with digital content, fostering inclusivity and equal opportunities for all. <br></p>

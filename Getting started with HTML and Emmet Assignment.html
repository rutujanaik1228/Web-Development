    <h1>Question 1</h1>
    <h1>I am happy to Learn Web Deveopment</h1>
    <h1>Question 2</h1>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.You can use the comment tag to "hide" scripts from browsers without support for scripts (so they don't show them as plain text):The two forward slashes at the end of comment line (//) is the JavaScript comment symbol. This prevents JavaScript from executing the-->tag.The comment tag does not support any standard or event attributes.
    The comment tag does not support any event attributes.</p>
    <h1>Question 3</h1>
    <h2>Tags</h2>
    <p>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

        When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.
        
        An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.
        
        All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.
        Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
        If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)
        Syntax <tag> content </tag>
        Note: HTML Tags are always written in lowercase letters. The basic HTML tags are given below: 
        &lt;h1&gt; Paragraph Tag &lt;/h1&gt;
    </p>
    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p> An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.
        Note: Some elements does not have end tag and content, these elements are termed as empty elements or self-closing element or void elements.
        Example:&lt;p&gt; Hello world!!! &lt;/p&gt;
    </p>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
        Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
        Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
        The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
        The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
        You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.
        Example: 
        &lt;p style="height: 50px; color: blue"&gt; It will add style property in element &lt;/p&gt;
    </p>
    <h1>Question 4</h1>
    <p>&lt;caption&gt;---It specifies the caption (or title) of a table..
    </p>
    <p>&lt;br&gt;---It  produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
    </p>
    <p>&lt;table&gt;---It  represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Question 5</h1>
    <p>Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows you to write CSS faster by using abbreviations that expand into full code.

        It can save a lot of time when writing code because you can type a few characters and then expand them into a long block of code with a single keystroke. Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows you to write CSS faster by using abbreviations that expand into full code.</p>
    <p><u>Advantages of Emmet </u> <br>Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto-completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.It saves the time of programmer while writing the code.</p>

    <h1>Question 7</h1>
    <h2>Nesting operators</h2>
    <p>Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be placed inside or near the context element.</p>
    <p>Child: > ---You can use > operator to nest elements inside each other:</p>
    <p>Climb-up: ^ ---With ^ operator, you can climb one level up the tree and change context where following elements should appear:</p>
    <p>Sibling: + ---Use + operator to place elements near each other, on the same level:</p>
    <p>Multiplication: * ---With * operator you can define how many times element should be outputted:</p>
    <p>Grouping: () ---Parenthesises are used by Emmets power users for grouping subtrees in complex abbreviations:</p>

    <h1>Question 8</h1>
    <!-- Emmet: h1{Hello everyone}p{good evening} -->
    <h1>Hello everyone</h1>
    <p>good evening</p>
    <!-- Emmet: h2{Marks}>p*3{100} -->
    <h2>Marks
        <p>100</p>
        <p>100</p>
        <p>100</p>
    </h2>
    
    <h1>Question 9</h1>
    <h2>Self-colsing operators</h2>
    <p>    If a trailing / (slash) character is present in the start tag of an HTML element, HTML parsers ignore that slash character. This is important to remember when an element such as &lt;script&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;does require a closing tag. In this case, adding a trailing slash in the start tag does not close the element. However, some code formatters add the trailing slash character to the start tags of void elements to make them XHTML-compatible and more readable </p>
    <h2>meta Tags</h2>
    <p>The &lt;meta &gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

        &lt;meta &gt; tags always go inside the &lt;head &gt; element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), 
        and other web services.There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the &lt;meta &gt; tag</p>
    
    <h2>Question 10</h2>
    <h3>Global Attributes</h3>
    <p>Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements. Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as &lt;foo hidden&gt;…&lt;/foo&gt;, even though &lt;foo is not a valid HTML element.</p>
    <h4>Some global attributes are:</h4>
    <p>1. style --- The style global attribute contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the &lt;style&gt; element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.</p>
    <p>2. titile ---The title global attribute contains text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to.</p>
    <p>3. dir ---The dir global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates the directionality of the element's text.</p>
    <p>4. is ---The is global attribute allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a defined custom built-in element (see Using custom elements for more details).

        This attribute can only be used if the specified custom element name has been successfully defined in the current document, and extends the element type it is being applied to.</p>
    <p>5. class ---The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the case-sensitive classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the DOM method  </p>
